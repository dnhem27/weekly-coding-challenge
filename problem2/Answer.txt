Correct Answer:

(b) if the data in statement II alone are sufficient to answer the question;

Explanation:

The question asks for a specific day in a month that is the fourteenth day of a given month. Thus, based on statement II, it is sufficient to determine the answer because assuming the third Saturday of the month is seventeenth we can tell that:

* The sixteenth day will be Friday.
* The fifteenth day will be Thursday.
* The fourteenth day will be Wednesday.

Therefore, Wednesday is the fourteenth day of the given month using only statement II as a clue to derive the answer.
